CS50 Finance

Built a web based tool that allowed checking stock prices and
portfolio values and buying and selling stocks. This tool 
included features such as a transactions history view and user 
password settings.

 + empower users whoâ€™ve forgotten their password to reset it 
(as by having them register with an email address so that you can email them a link via which to do so).
